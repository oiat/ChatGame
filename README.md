# Chat Game
## Introduction

Generative AI is booming, and so is the creation of fakes and deep fakes. At the same time, there is a lack of fun and easy-to-use deep fake detection exercises in schools. This is where Fight Fakes comes in, developing a game environment where young people can playfully learn to evaluate information quickly and intuitively. 

The Chat Game is part of Fight Fakes. This game simulates a chat where text messages, pictures and videos can be sent and answered by other players. 

Fight Fakes is a project of the [Ã–IAT](https://oiat.at/) initiatitve [Saferinternet.at](https://saferinternet.at/) and was funded by [netidee](https://www.netidee.at/). More information about the project can be found here: [https://www.saferinternet.at/projekte/fight-fakes](https://www.saferinternet.at/projekte/fight-fakes).
